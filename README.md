<b>PROBLEM</b>
The domains of philosophy are easy to classify - they are Logic, Aesthetics, Epistemology, Ethics and Metaphysics. Would the best map of human knowledge - Wikipedia - match this? This program web-crawls Wikipedia and exports article titles and links for further analysis in Graphia.

<b>RESULTS</b>
After scraping ~95% of article titles, the outer nodes (besides the known center Philosophy) are found to be Latin and History (see the top plot). This suggests a bias towards human history.
